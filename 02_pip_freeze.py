# Pip Freeze Command 
'''Pip freeze returns all the packages installed in a given python
environment along with the versions.
pip freeze > requirements.txt
The command above creates a file named 'requirements.txt' in the 
same directory containing the output of pip freeze.

We can also distribute the created file to other users and they 
can recreate the same environment using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors-game

This is a small project I made on 2 November, 2022 about a Rock, Paper & Scissors game that allows users to play against a computer. It takes in input from the user, who gets to pick from one of three options and their choice is then compared to "computer's" choice which is chosen randomly. Finally, after the comparision, the user learns if they have won or lost the round.
